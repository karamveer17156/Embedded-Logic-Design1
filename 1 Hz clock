// this is a code to build a simple 1 hz clock on FPGA
//We know that FPGA onboard clock runs on 100Mhz and using conventional counter, one cannot divide this to get 1 hz clock.
// the main logic is to create a register and update its value after half of 50M times.
//for better explanation: Fpga clock will run for 100M times in 1 second
//here is the code

module Clock_1_sec(
  input clk,
  output reg out_clk = 0
);
int count = 0;
  always@(posedge clk)
  begin
  if(count>50000000)
  begin
    count <= 0;
    out_clk <= ~out_clk;
  end
  count<= count+1;  
  end

endmodule
